# WELPCR
WELPCR is a low-cost PCR machine for DNA amplification. It is basically a thermocycler that used a peltier as heat pump, STM32F10 microcontroller, a power supply of 12V, 10A. Samples are loaded in WELPCR using 0.2ml Eppendorf tubes. To prevent the condensation on tube lid, the tube lid is heated to 100 Â°C. The lid is heated using nichrome heater. Temperature sensors are attached to both, lid and tube holder to send feedback. It also has an LCD display screen. It takes nearly 2 hours to perform 35 cycles. Cost of BOM is less than 10,000 Rupees.
