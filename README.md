# WELPCR
WELPCR is a low-cost polymerase chain reaction (PCR) thermal cycler for DNA amplification, developed at the [Wadhwani Electronics Lab (WEL)](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~wel_iitb/), [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/). It is inspired by the [OpenPCR](https://openpcr.org/) design and is a standalone device which does not require connection to a computer or a mobile device for configuration and operation. The bill of materials (BOM) cost for assembling one unit of WELPCR is less than INR Rs. 10,000 (approximately USD $120), which makes it a great resource for educational and research use in laboratories with limited resources. The WELPCR design is open-source and made available for developers interested in assembling their own units.
